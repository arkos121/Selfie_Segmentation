Developling a feature for the Titan Smart World application that allows users to create a custom watchface for thier smart watches. 
Using ML Kit to intergrate the machine learning model for removal of the background of the image and add a different background if necessary. 
Starting with uploading the image to the gallery and then moving on to the labelling and preprocessing part of the model.
Will have to integrate color segmentation later to enhance the user experience and develop suggestions to place the watch features on the custom watch face.
